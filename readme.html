Stochastic model of STP at the Calyx of Held
--------------------------------------------

This model investigates mechanisms contributing to short term
plasticity at the calyx of Held, a giant glutamatergic synapse
in the mammalian brainstem auditory system. It is a stochastic
version of the model described in:
 
Hennig, M., Postlethwaite, M., Forsythe, I.D. and Graham, B.P. (2007). 
A biophysical model of short-term plasticity at the calyx of Held. 
Neurocomputing, 70:1626-1629.

This version introduces stochastic vesicle recycling and release.
It has been used to investigate the information transmission
properties of this synapse, as detailed in:

Yang, Z., Hennig, M., Postlethwaite, M., Forsythe, I.D. and Graham, B.P. (2008). 
Wide-band information transmission at the calyx of Held. 
Neural Computation, 21(4):991-1018.

The model is written in Matlab. The provided main file runs the
model for 1 second of simulated time with stimulation by regular
frequencies of 10, 20, 50 and 100Hz, for comparison with
experimental data from the calyx.  A graph similar to Figure 1 from
the paper is created:
